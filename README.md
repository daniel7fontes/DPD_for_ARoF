# DPD for ARoF
This repository contains Notebooks and Python codes for the numerical implementation and analysis of Digital Predistortion schemes based on Neural Networks and Memory Polynomials applied to Analog Radio over Fiber systems. This is part of my master's dissertation in Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Campina Grande, advised by Prof. Edson Porto.
